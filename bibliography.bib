	abstract = {Latent class analysis (LCA) is a statistical procedure used to identify qualitatively different subgroups within populations who often share certain outward characteristics. The assumption underlying LCA is that membership in unobserved groups (or classes) can be explained by patterns of scores across survey questions, assessment indicators, or scales. The application of LCA is an active area of research and continues to evolve. As more researchers begin to apply the approach, detailed information on key considerations in conducting LCA is needed. In the present article, we describe LCA, review key elements to consider when conducting LCA, and provide an example of its application.},

	abstract = {Traditional applications of latent class models (LCMs) often focus on scenarios where a set of unobserved classes are well-defined and easily distinguishable. However, in numerous real-world applications, these classes are weakly separated and difficult to distinguish, creating significant numerical challenges. To address these issues, we have developed an R package ddtlcm that provides comprehensive analysis and visualization tools designed to enhance the robustness and interpretability of LCMs in the presence of weak class separation, particularly useful for small sample sizes. This package implements a tree-regularized Bayesian LCM that leverages statistical strength between latent classes to make better estimates using limited data. A Shiny app has also been developed to improve user interactivity. In this paper, we showcase a typical analysis pipeline with simulated data using ddtlcm. All software has been made publicly available on CRAN and GitHub.},

	abstract = {Dietary patterns synthesize multiple related diet components, which can be used by nutrition researchers to examine diet-disease relationships. Latent class models (LCMs) have been used to derive dietary patterns from dietary intake assessment, where each class profile represents the probabilities of exposure to a set of diet components. However, LCM-derived dietary patterns can exhibit strong similarities, or weak separation, resulting in numerical and inferential instabilities that challenge scientific interpretation. This issue is exacerbated in small-sized subpopulations. To address these issues, we provide a simple solution that empowers LCMs to improve dietary pattern estimation. We develop a tree-regularized Bayesian LCM that shares statistical strength between dietary patterns to make better estimates using limited data. This is achieved via a Dirichlet diffusion tree process that specifies a prior distribution for the unknown tree over classes. Dietary patterns that share proximity to one another in the tree are shrunk towards ancestral dietary patterns a priori, with the degree of shrinkage varying across pre-specified food groups. Using dietary intake data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, we apply the proposed approach to a sample of 496 US adults of South American ethnic background to identify and compare dietary patterns.},

	abstract = {We study the properties of a three-step approach to estimating the parameters of a latent structure model for categorical data and propose a simple correction for a common source of bias. Such models have a measurement part (essentially the latent class model) and a structural (causal) part (essentially a system of logit equations). In the three-step approach, a stand-alone measurement model is first defined and its parameters are estimated. Individual predicted scores on the latent variables are then computed from the parameter estimates of the measurement model and the individual observed scoring patterns on the indicators. Finally, these predicted scores are used in the causal part and treated as observed variables. We show that such a naive use of predicted latent scores cannot be recommended since it leads to a systematic underestimation of the strength of the association among the variables in the structural part of the models. However, a simple correction procedure can eliminate this systematic bias. This approach is illustrated on simulated and real data. A method that uses multiple imputation to account for the fact that the predicted latent variables are random variables can produce standard errors for the parameters in the structural part of the model.},
